### The aim of this project is to implement and apply the SAXPY function using C for user input and assembly for computational purposes. Furthermore, this project uses the `time.h` library to compare the time difference between the application of SAXPY through the use of C alone and C with assembly used for computations.

## Comparative Analysis
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bde86de-ddb8-41f0-b79d-a38d19ccb62e)
- In all the given cases, Assembly (x86_64) performed significantly faster than its C counterpart, with Assembly performing 45-62% faster than C. This highlights Assembly's advantage when it comes to computational execution speeds due to it being directly assembled to the machine's CPU.


## Instructions on how to run the Program
1. Clone the repository to your Local Computer
2. Make sure that you have `gcc` compiler along with the assembly compiler. Do note that the project used NASM as an assembly compiler.
3. Run the `startprogram.bat` file found in the folder to run the program.
